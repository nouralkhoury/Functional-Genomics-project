# Functional-Genomics-project
This is the final project (on which i got an A) in the functional genomics course during the 2019 spring semester.

about the project:
In this project we were given real Exome data. Each student was expected to work on 1 chromosome only. 
we used GATK pipeline to identify variants.
we did quality control manually, but all other steps were automated. 
we used biomart to annotate the results and we also did enrichment analysis.
